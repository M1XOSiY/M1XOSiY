Hey! I'm Mookie/Madi and you'll usually find me around Hoyoverse fandom on PonyTown.

I'd love to have friends so please don't be afraid to ask! I can be awkward and shy at first so don't mind that <3.

DNI If you're a proshipper or just geniunely a bad person, I'll block you if I find something we don't agree on and/or other reasons.

This *README* is temporary for my introduction to possible friends and/or pookies.
